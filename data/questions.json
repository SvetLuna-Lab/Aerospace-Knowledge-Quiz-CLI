    "question": "What is specific impulse (Isp) in rocket engines?",
    "options": [
      "The total thrust produced during the entire flight",
      "Thrust per unit weight flow of propellant, a measure of engine efficiency",
      "The maximum pressure in the combustion chamber",
      "The ratio between oxidizer and fuel mass"
    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Specific impulse (Isp) measures how effectively a rocket engine uses propellant: thrust per unit weight flow of propellant. Higher Isp means more efficient engines."

    "question": "What is the thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W) of a launch vehicle?",
    "options": [
      "The ratio of propellant mass to dry mass",
      "The ratio of engine chamber pressure to ambient pressure",
      "The ratio of engine thrust to vehicle weight at liftoff",
      "The ratio of nozzle exit area to throat area"
    ],
    "correct_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Thrust-to-weight (T/W) is the ratio of engine thrust to vehicle weight. T/W > 1 is required to lift off; higher values give stronger initial acceleration."

    "question": "Why are bell-shaped nozzles used in many liquid rocket engines?",
    "options": [
      "They are cheaper to manufacture than conical nozzles",
      "They provide better expansion efficiency and higher performance for a given length",
      "They cool the exhaust gases more effectively",
      "They reduce combustion instability"
    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Bell (contour) nozzles improve expansion efficiency and performance for a given nozzle length, reducing losses compared to simple conical nozzles."

    "options": [
      "The ratio of engine mass to payload mass",
      "The ratio of oxidizer mass flow to fuel mass flow",
      "The ratio of nozzle exit pressure to chamber pressure",
      "The ratio of thrust to specific impulse"
    ],
    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Mixture ratio (oxidizer-to-fuel, O/F) is the ratio of oxidizer mass flow to fuel mass flow. It strongly affects performance, stability and cooling."
